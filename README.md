# Density_sampling
In main.py, first learn the distribution by X_train (via Tucker SVD). Next, sampling N points based on the learned distribution. Compute the several distance metric to show the similarities of X_test (homologous with X_train) and the samples. 
Compare the results with Kernel Density Estimator + MCMC sampling.
